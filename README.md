<img width="3000" height="900" alt="logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebfe4164-bf57-485f-ac5b-b7220c551612" />

## Overview

OATIS is a tally indicator system for use in Radio and TV that is platform agnostic, designed to run on Mac OSX and Linux, support is not gauranteed for Windows as it has not currently been tested (I don't own a Windows PC...).

Designed to operate in a server-client model, multiple displays can be centrally managed using a lightweight server application and configuration tool.

Tally's can be triggered either from Physical GPI's or via OSC commands.

## Features
### Customizable displays:
- Configure the number of indicators to display(currently up to 6), their colour and text. (More indicators will be available in the next release)
- Customizable logos.
- Choose between Analogue and Studio Style Clocks.
- Choice of a variety of display layouts.

- Client displays can be used to show short messages by way of a scrolling ticker at the top of the screen.
- The background colour of each message can be chosen by the user.
- Clients are segregated into logical Messaging groups for sending messages to a group of clients.
- Message console application for sending messages to clients.

# Setup

If you are using Physical GPI's the Arduino needs to be flashed with the Firmata code to enable communication via serial with OATIS. See below for steps how to do this.

## Microcontroller Setup 

Currently the application has been designed to use the Arduino Uno R3 Microcontroller for GPI's using the Firmata protocol to notify the application of GPI state changes.

Open Arduino IDE, navigate to Tools > Manage Libraries

Upload the Sketch to your Board, your now ready to use the microcontroller with OATIS.

## Set Server IP Address

Launch the Config tool using the main_config_tool.py script, navigate to the Server Config tab.\
Select IP Settings.\
Use the dropdown to select the interface you would like to use for server communication. Each entry in the dropdown will be an ip address of an active interface on the machine.\
A loopback IP address will also be shown which can be used for system testing if you want to run the client and server on the same machine.

Once selected hit save.

## Adding Microcontrollers

Navigate to the GPIO Config tab.\
Hit Add Controller.\
Enter a name for the controller.\
If the controller is running on the same machine as the server - select local\
If the controller is running on another machine - select remote (Not yet implemented - Will be in next release)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6e568bf-65eb-4089-bae5-73bbf46de76f)

Use the COM port dropdown to select the USB-Serial port to use to communicate with the Arduino

Once done, hit save.

## Creating Trigger Groups
Trigger Groups are used to group physical and logical triggers to target indicator lights.\
Trigger Types:
- Controller: A Physical GPI on a microcontroller
- Network: An inbound OSC Message

Go to the Trigger Groups Tab\
Set a name for the Trigger Group.\
For each indicator choose the controller that will be the source trigger.\
If the network controller is selected, an OSC address for triggering that indicator will automatically populate.\
If a physical controller is selected select the source GPI.\
If you are not planning on using all the indicators leave these set to Network.

# Launching the Server
Launch the server using the main_server.py script.\
Make sure any physical GPIO controllers are plugged in when launching hte server application and that you have set the server IP address in config tool before launching.\
If you don't set the IP address the server will default to the loopback address of 127.0.0.1.\
If you change the server IP address when the server is running, you will need to restart the server for this to take affect.

The server will report it's status at regular intervals, if everything is ok the terminal output should look similar to below:
<img width="665" height="100" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 18 33 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2015ddc8-ed01-4b26-9be2-f7eed497ba38" />

# Launching the Remote Client
Launch the main_client.py script.
On the first run the terminal window will prompt you to set the IP address to use for the client and the server, follow the prompts.\
Once these IP's have been set the client will boot straight up in future.\
If you need to change these in the future amend the settings file in /client/data/settings.json and reboot the client.

<img width="523" height="113" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 20 16 45" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27fe70be-9ff4-4b91-9150-aad5876c3f86" />

If the client has a successfull connection to the server, the small circular indicator in the bottom of the clockface will remain grey. If the server cannot be reached this will flash red.

#Launching the Message Console
Launch the main_message_console.py script.\
On first run it will default to the loopback address and will probably show Server Offline if the server is using a different IP.

<img width="1918" height="45" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-20 at 20 29 48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ba43ee8-4703-4991-a3b5-33c7e6e10ec1" />

To set the IP of the Message Console, hit ESC to bring up the configuration window.\
Use the dropdown to set the device IP and enter the Server IP.\
Hit Save, you will automatically return to the Message Console main screen.

If you've set everything correctly, Message Groups assigned ot devices will populate in the GUI.\
The status bar will show as below:

## Sending a Message
Use the top free-text field to enter your message.\
Choose a background colour.\
Select which message groups you want to send the message to and move these to the selected groups column using the arrow.\
Once happy click the green arrow to make the message active.\
The message groups will move to the active messages column.
